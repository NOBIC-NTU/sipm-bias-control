# Introduction

This file contains zemax model files for the collection optics used to modify an existing multiphoton microscope to use a SiPM detector.  The optimization functions in Zemax are provided to simply adopting this design to any other microscope. Note that for optimal performance, illumination on the SiPM should be uniform and independent of the scan position (in a Fourier plane of the object).
